The web is full of servers that hold data, request data, or view data. These servers talk to each other over the Internet.
One way computers communicate is over the world wide web, an interconnected system of public web pages accessible through the Internet.
When computers or servers try to make a request, they will do so through a router, which connects machines.


When a user types a domain into the search bar, the computer will make a request, reaching the app server.
Following that, the app code will execute and start to run the page; the page will then receive the HTML code and begin to run that.
Once the HTML finishes running, the page will start to render in the users' browser.
